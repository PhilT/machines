# BE CAREFUL: THIS FILE IS ALSO WRITTEN TO BY MACHINES
# This config file is used to read and also write machine settings.
#
# Each machine represents a physical (or virtual) computer in your server architecture
# This is used to determine where to point database connections from app servers. This
# information is stored in the machines.yml file and used on subsequent calls to machines
# Because of this database servers must be created before application servers.
#
#
# Edit this file to setup your initial machines. If using EC2 machines
# will populate the address setting with the new instance.
#
# For example:
#     machines build dbmaster # creates the master database and sets address
#   then:
#     machines build production # creates the production app server and set db to point to address under dbmaster
#
# machine_name:
#   hostname: Used to set the hostname of the machine (e.g. main.electricvisions.com)
#   ec2: Set to true to tell machines to create a new ec2 instance (unless address is already set)
#   address: IP or DNS name of the machine (this is populated automatically when creating EC2 machines)
#   environment: Rails.env to use
#   apps: An array of apps to setup on this machine (if nil sets up all)
#   roles: Roles of the server (Roles known by standard template are: app, db, dbmaster, dbslave)
