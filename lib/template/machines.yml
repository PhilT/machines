# BE CAREFUL: THIS FILE IS ALSO WRITTEN TO BY MACHINES
# This config file is used to read and also write machine settings.
# You can replace these comments with your own. Comment lines will be retained upto

#
# THIS CONTAINS A NUMBER OF PASSWORDS. SETTING PROPER PERMISSIONS IS HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
#
# Each machine represents a physical (or virtual) computer in your server architecture. This file
# is used to determine where to point database connections from app servers. Because of this,
# database servers must be created before application servers.
#
# Edit this file to setup your initial machines. If using EC2, Machines will populate the
# address setting with the new instance that is created.
#
# For example:
#     machines build maindb # creates the master database and sets address in machines.yml
#   then:
#     machines build production # creates the app server and sets db to point to maindb
#
# machines:
#   <machine_name>:
#     hostname: Used to set the hostname of the machine (e.g. main.electricvisions.com)
#     address: IP or DNS name of the machine (this is populated automatically when creating EC2 machines)
#     user: User to login as and to identify the  users/ folder to use
#     environment: Rails.env to use
#     apps: An array of apps to setup on this machine (if nil sets up all)
#     roles: Roles of the server (Roles known by standard template are: app, db, dbmaster, dbslave)
#     db_server: Db server that will be used or replicated from (e.g. db_server: maindb).
#     root_pass: Root password for db servers - Leave blank to generate one
#     replication_user: User to connect with when replicating
#     replication_pass: Password to connect with when replicating
#     ec2: tells Machines to create a new ec2 instance (unless address is already set)
#       type: Size of EC2 instance
#         32 bit instances - t1.micro, m1.small, m1.medium
#         64 bit instances - m1.large, m1.xlarge, c1.xlarge, cc1.4xlarge, cg1.4xlarge, m2.xlarge, m2.2xlarge, m2.4xlarge
#       ami: Amazon Machine Image - Choose your preferred AMI at http://alestic.com/ (e.g. ami-11f0cc65 - EU West 32 bit Ubuntu 11.10 EBS)
#       region: Location of instance (e.g. ec2.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com)
#       public_key_path: Path to public key file
#       private_key_path: Path to private key file
#       username: Instance username (Canonical uses 'ubuntu' in it's AMIs)
#       security_group: Security group you setup on Amazon -  (e.g. ev-public)
